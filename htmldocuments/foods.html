            <p>Hi! I have a <strong>HUGE</strong> sweet tooth, and waste all of my money eating out. So, I thought it would be a good idea to share
                some of my favorite cafes and restaurants to visit, and what I enjoy ordering!

                 <figcaption>Like many other Southern Californians, I love going to Porto's Bakery and Cafe! 
                  Particularly, I love getting their breakfast item, Torrejas, which is a Cuban French Toast. I went out to 
                  breakfast with my sister over winter break to eat this. It was very tasty, and cheap too, costing only about 8 dollars. Yum!

                 </div>
                 <figcaption>Recently, I found myself at Rendes Vous Cafe in Corona Del Mar, California. This restaurant was playing French music, and had 
                  a very beautiful and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. I ordered a Dulce de Leche Crepe, and it was delicious!

                 <figcaption>This past summer, I had brunch with a friend at Take Ur Seat in Chino Hills, California, where I tried these Ube Pancakes. 
                  They were very fluffy, airy, and the Ube flavoring blended really well with it. I also enjoyed the fruit.
